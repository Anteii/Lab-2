 Here we go..  You're just like an angel.  Your skin makes me cry.  You flow like a feather.  In a beautiful world.  You're so very special.  I wish I was special.  But I'm a creep.  And I'm always a fool.  What in the hell am I doing here?.  I don't belong here.  I don't care the hurts.  I wanna have control.  I ain't want a perfect body.  I want a perfect soul.  I want you to notice.  When I'm not around.  You're so special.  I wish I was special.  But I'm a creep.  And I'm always a fool.  What in the hell am I doing here?.  I don't belong here.  Oh, oh, now she's.  Running out the door.  She's running out.  She'll run, run, run, run.  Run, run.  Whatever makes you happy.  Whatever you want.  You're so special.  I wish I was special.  But I'm a creep.  And I'm always a fool.  What in the hell am I doing here?.  I don't belong here.  I don't belong here
